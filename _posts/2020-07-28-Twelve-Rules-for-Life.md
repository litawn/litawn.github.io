Evergreen notes and Twelve Rules for lif

Life is about living
    It's not about being the most productive, or most impactful, or happiest, or most rational, or to have the most resources
    It's about both the experiencing and remembering self. 
Humans act in deeply rational ways
We are fashioned after the whims of evolution and other "primordial gods", but not beholden to their laws. 
Design your environment, it's more important than you think.
    I'm an impulsive fly and jumper a rounder
    You're *incredibly close* to another unhealthy and pointless Reddit/YouTube/Facebook/Twitter/gaming binge. 
Choose 
Compare yourself to who you were yesterday rather than others.
    Like any behavior or inclination, 
Choose romantic relationships wisely, marry well.
